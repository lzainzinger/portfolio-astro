**JARVIS** is a simple web crawler, which saves all files and text parts of a webpage in individual files on a local disk.
I was assigned to be the mentor in this project since I have been the only one with some years of coding experience with Java. 
I created a simple software design and taught the group Java, GIT and Agile Project Management. 
As already mentioned, we used Java to develop the application and Kanban as the project management system.	

Technologies used:
- **JAVA 11** for the GUI and functionality
- **JSoup** for webcrawling
