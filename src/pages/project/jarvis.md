**JARVIS** is a Webcrawler that is also able to download different files and text from a given website and is therefore useful for research work.  
This project was part of the Programming Class at FH Campus Wien in my 1st Semester of Computer Science and Digital Communication.

Technologies used:
- **JAVA 11** for the GUI and functionality
- **JSoup** for webcrawling
