**Pet2Go** is a map-based web application for pet sharing purposes. It connects the user with a person who will take the animal on a walk or take care of it while the owner is at work or on vacation. 
All pets available are shown on a map and can easily be rented from users.
I was the Product Owner of the project, I took care of the software design as well as the implementation of the map functions. 
We used Kanban as a project management system and  PHP, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 were used to develop the application.	

Technologies used:
- **HTML5** for the frontend
- **CSS3** for the frontend
- **Javascript** for frontend functions
- **Google Maps API** for map display
- **MariaDB** as a Database
- **Propel ORM** for DB mapping
