**Pet2Go** is a Google Maps based website to show available pets that need to be walked or taken care of. Users are split in Owners who own a Pet and Walkers who are wanting to watch and pet Pets.  
This project was part of the Web Technologies Class at FH Campus Wien in my 2nd Semester of Computer Science and Digital Communication.

Technologies used:
- **HTML5** for the frontend
- **CSS3** for the frontend
- **Javascript** for frontend functions
- **Google Maps API** for map display
- **MariaDB** as a Database
- **Propel ORM** for DB mapping
